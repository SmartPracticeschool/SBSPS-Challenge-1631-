## Project demonstration : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADPPpY6ZEI8&feature=youtu.be

This proposal is for the sentiment analysis of Indians after the announcements pertaining to the extension of lockdown, from relevant #tags on twitter and build a predictive analytics model to understand the behaviour of people if the lockdown is further extended. 
This is also followed by visualization of the prediction and then a dashboard is also displayed with regards to the people’s reaction and emotion towards the government's  decision. 
Followed by the reason why that specific conclusion arrived and identifying the triggers and parameters for the final result.
